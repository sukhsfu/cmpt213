Question 1: Explain how the board will be drawn?
Answer: First Board is filled with walls, then using the  recursive backtracking some of the walls are removed. After that all the
2*2 blocks of walls are removed using the function and then similarly 2*2 blocks of open cells are removed. Then using breadth first search
all the blocks that are not walls are made accessible from starting hero's position. Thus instance of board is created and passed to maze class.




Question 2: How are the hero's movement handled?
Answer: The hero's movement are handled using switch statements in the screen.java class. When the user enters either WASD, an integer number is passed into a respective function which decides how the game reacts to the movement.
